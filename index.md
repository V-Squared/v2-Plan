# Purpose <a name="purpose"></a>
V²Plan is our vision, guide and methodology to mange all our projects from beginning to end :

- Show where we are and where we are going
- Make it easy for Contributors to find where to help or what to do
- Quick to check if we stay on track
- Help to judge which path to choose
- Ensure that all projects work in harmony towards our *True North*


# Elements <a name="elements"></a>
1. **Target:** The target is expressed in **V² True North** which is a vision on how the world will look like in 2021 after the successful introduction of V², showing how V² improves your life. It shows the user where we are going and directs the contributor how to get there.
2. **Road Map:** **The Road Map** shows the way to reach **V² True North** via consecutive **Campaigns**. A campaign is a group of **Milestones** and lasts about 3 months while focusing all our efforts.
3. **Dashboard:**  Easy to read status board showing progress for **Milestones**, **Sprints**, **Issues** and **Tasks** with lots of easily configurable filters to narrow down the information. Good starting point to get involved.
4. **V²Plan System** is a generic Agile Development and Toyota Production System  that we use to get the job done in V². Unique Features: **1)** Full GitHub Issues Integration. **2)** Cross Repo Management **3)** Visualization of Progress in Road Maps and Gantt Charts. **4)** Dashboard to show progress and filter view on work. V²Plan System can be easily adapted for other GitHub Organizations. 



# Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

**Motivation for All:** The more contribution the V² Initiative receives, the faster we reach our Goal. V² Plan is our key tool to attract new contributors. As such we are very motivated to:

1. Offer an attractive target in V² True North
2. Show a believable path to reach the target
3. Show our success is likely because we came already more than half way
4. Show how easy and efficient it is to contribute

**Motivating Contributors:** 

1. Contributors measure the health of an Open Source Project by checking out its statistics. V²Plan workflow is designed to generate GitHub statistics that show the project development is active and healthy in order to attract contributors.
2. Contributing is very straight forward using **GitHub Issues** and **GitHub Flow**.
3. Responses to **Pull Requests** are fast.
4. **V²Dashboard** in **V²Plan System** make it fast for a Contributor to find work and to monitor progress.


# V²Plan System is the engine of V²Plan <a name="engine"></a>
V² is a *Standard Organization* with over 20 contributors and over 100 projects [^1] managed across a decade. We think highly of GitHub Issues and use it to its full extend to manage our projects. But we simply needed more. V²Plan System begins where GitHub Issues ends: It adds visual tools for Targets, Directions and Dashboards. It also adds documentation on our workflow for Agile Development and Toyota Production System and tutorials on how get the job done. For more information please see → [Introduction to V²Plan System](https://v-squared.github.io/v2-Plan/system/)
