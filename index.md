- Show where we are and where we are going
- Make it easy for Contributors to find where to help or what to do
- Quick to check if we stay on track
- Help to judge which path to choose
- Ensure that all projects work in harmony towards our *True North*



## Elements <a name="elements"></a>
1. **Target:** The target is expressed in **V² True North** which is a vision on how the world will look like in 2021 after the successful introduction of V², showing how V² improves your life. It shows the user where we are going and directs the contributor how to get there.
