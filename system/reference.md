We have several User Manual on how to work within V²Plan. They are very hands on and their read is highly recommended. This Article however is a more theoretical look behind the scenes. It shows you the Architecture of V² Plan and sometimes adds the thinking on why we made particular choices. This background information will help you to better remember the workflows as described in other manuals:

*??? Use the True North Version I already have! ???*

## Reaching the Right True North
We spelled out the Goal of V² in *True North* by drawing a *Vision* on how the world will look like in 2021 after the successful introduction of V². This vision has been created with the community and is shown very visibly on the *V² Home Page* and *Plan Home Page* for two reasons:

1. **Picking the right Goal:** We spend endless discussions with key members of the community to spell out *True North*. Great care was taken to choose *True North* so that we create something that **a)** is missing in the *Industry* and **b)** nobody else seems to be working on and most importantly **c)** is something that the *Community* deeply misses.
2. **Constant Review:** By placing *True North* in a very prominent position and by always motivating contribution the V² Goal is under constant review and improvement. Ensuring that the V² Goal is as close as possible to what the *Community* really wants.
3. **Make best choices towards True North:**  When faced with different options each *Contributor* can find the best option by asking the question: Which choice will bring us closer to *True North*?


## Strict Hierarchical Structure
![](http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-infographic-examples-food-pyramid-cake-154247843.jpg)

*??? Create Icon for each Item (we do anyways for another illustration). Draw Pyramid as above. Add short Tooltips. Link to longer text below **Tip:** use the shade web site tool from Lukas to create 7 shades of our Primary color ???*

 
Reaching *V² True North* is a *Big Undertaking*. Using a *Strict Hierarchical Structure* is essential for a *Divide and Conquer* approach that cuts the *Big Undertaking* in ever smaller pieces, until they are simple *Tasks* which are *assigned* and *worked down*. The *Architecture* described below fits the key management tool that *GitHub* provides, which is *GitHub Issues*. For working down aka *Burndown* the *Issues* we are using the *Methodology* of *Agile Development* with its key tool *Sprint* that is manged with a *Scrum Board*.

1. **V²True North:**<a name="v2-true-north"></a> A Vision on how the world will look like in 2021 after the successful introduction of V² showing how V² improves your life. It shows you where we are going and directs us to go there.
2. **V²Road Map:** The Road Map is the visual representation on how we are moving from today to our final *Goal* that is *True North*. We are doing this is via steps called *Campaigns*. The Goal of each Campaign is strategically chosen as to sit upon the shoulder of the previous *Campaign* and at the same time the new Goal brings us forward as much as possible towards *True North*. 
3. **V²Campaigns:**<a name="v2-campaigns"></a> We have about four campaigns / year. Each campaigns focus all V² activities onto a single goal on a very high level. This is why they are listed directly on the V² Home Page. Only one campaign is active at any given time. Before a new campaign is opened, the old one is closed, evaluated and archived. Typically *Projects* aka *Milestones* do not carry over from one campaign to another.
4. **V²Milestones:**<a name="v2-milestones"></a> About 10 Milestones make up one campaign and their dependencies are visualized in a Gantt Chart. A *Milestone* is a bucket of *Issues* with a completion date. In a more traditional *Terminology* *Milestone* would be the *Big Project* comprised of *Small Projects* aka *Issues*. The completion of the last Issue marks a *Milestone* of the *Campaign*,  thus the name. A Milestone in the Campaign Chart is linked to *GitHub Milestones".
5. **V²Sprints:** Each Milestone is broken down into *Sprints*, which itself is a bucket of *GitHub Issues*, making it easy for you to get involved. A *Sprint* lasts between 1 ... 4 weeks and is a process in *Agile Development* to work down aka *burndown* *Issues* for the purpose to output an Incremental Product Release.
6. **V²Issues:** An Issue begins either with a *User Story* or *Specifications* of what needs to be done. It may have suggestions on *Implementation* and *References* to resources. The *Issue Owner* is responsible to complete the issue whereas the *Issue Assignee* gets the work done. The work to be done is spelled out in the very top with the *Tasks Checklist*. It is possible to assign a *Task* to a third person using *@mentions*. Each *Issue* is assigned to one *Milestone*. 
7. **V²Tasks:** Finally we reached the point where work actually gets done. The top of the *Issue* contains the *Tasks Checklist*. The *Issue Assignee* is automatically assigned to it. If however you want to assign one task to another person you can do that with *@mentions*. In average an Issue contains about 5 Tasks. Ticking off task moves the *Progress Bar* of a *Issue* forward.

**Tip:** There has been a heated discussions on the chosen *Nomenclature*. A lot of members where most unhappy about how *Milestone* and *Issue* are defined above. However, this is how *GitHub Issues* defines and uses these *Terms*. Since we are working with *GitHub Issues* we all agreed to use these *Terms* consistently with *GitHub* to avoid confusion when you will read up on *GitHub Documentation* on how to use *GitHub Issues*.


## Making the Plan easy to understand
The best way to reach our target in an effective way on time is to deliver easy to find answers to the following questions: **1)** Where are we going? **2)** What work needs to be done? **3)** how to track if we are on time? V²Plan delivers exactly that! 

## Making the Plan Fun
![](http://images.clipartpanda.com/strife-clipart-family-fun.svg)
*??? Color it with our shades. Add a jumping Phoenix ???*

If it is fun you'll do a good Job! Adding fun to the plan by:

1. **Fast in use:** Working fast is always more fun than working slow
2. **Lots if Visualization:** Looking at Infographics is more fun than reading lots of text
3. **Very good structure:** It is easy to find things and once done, they make sense
4. **Short meetings:** Opportunities to show your work and to get a compliment or to ask and receive help. It is also motivating to see the progress by others.
5. **Visible Progress:** We (or the tools we use) publish progress frequently in easy to read charts. It is always motivating seeing the work is moving along.

## Fast to look up information
By making it very fast to look up information two things are happening:

1. **Work is more accurate:** By using actual reference instead of working from memory the work done becomes more accurate
2. **Progress reports are more up to date:** Since the Issue with the Task Checklist is already open when you work  (fast to find) it is convenient enough to tick the task when done.

## Promote the Plan on V² Home Page
*??? Snap shot of the Plan Section of V² Home Page after we added the Portfolio Images ???*

Say you evaluate V² for the first time. You will quickly realize that V² is a *Big Undertaking*. Instantly you will ask yourself: "Can they do it?". If your answer to this question is "No" then you will leave and we have lost a wonderful *Supporter* to V². The purpose of the *V² Plan* is to convincingly show that we know where we are going: *True North* and that we have a good plan and enough resources to execute it. And we are showing that most of the work has been already completed. In other words, if we got this far, we can finish up the rest. Now that you believe in our success, you can use the plan to check out if that what you need has been already completed, or when it will become available. You may even consider contributing.

## Easy to contribute
![](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png)
*??? Get SVG from GitHub. Add bigger text. Use their text from GitHub Flow and add our Tooltips ???*

The success of V² Initiative depends on *Contribution*. As such it is essential for our success to make contribution easy. The Architecture in V²Plan makes it easy to contribute to make **1)** Feature Requests / Bug Reports, **2)** Contribute Work and **3)** Get involved  with Management, because the V²Plan Architecture is designed around the core *GitHub* tools: **GitHub <>Code Repositories** and **GitHub Issues**:

- **Bug Reporting, Feature Request & Tracking:** Technically it is part of *Management* and it uses the exact same tools of [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). But since most *V² Community Members* will get involved this way we have spelled it out here separately.
- **Work:** All *Work* happens in *GitHub <>Code*. We use the *GitHub* standard mechanism of *Contribution* which is [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). It is easy to learn, you do not need to install software. Anybody who is on GitHub knows about it. We use *GitHub Repositories* for: **1)** Source Code, **2)** Articles **3)** Web Sites **4)** Schematics, **4)** PCB files, **4)** Artwork, **5)** 3D Models, and anything else.
- **Management:** All our *Management* is done in [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). It is very intuitive to use, you do not need to install any app and anybody who is on GitHub uses it.


# Motivation via visible Progress <a name="motivation"></a>
![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7278716/14466638/3a39ff76-010a-11e6-803d-2822584a79b3.jpg)


As important it is to have a clear plan how to reach *True North* it is even more important to promote *Progress*. Otherwise many visitors will get frustrated about so much work that needs to be done and abandon V² out of fear we are not going to make it. 

## We are More than Half Way Through
*??? Our Time Line Illustration ???*
That it is 5 years to reach the final "True North" will look not so daunting any more if we deliver this method in the same breath that we started in 2011 already and that now we are more than half way through. We will do this by showing the *Big Picture Timeline* in the *Introduction* of the *V² Home Page* 

## Breakthrough Milestone only 3 month later
And even more motivating is to show that a major desirable thing is available only 3 months later. This is done in the "This Year Timeline", right under the *Big Picture Timeline*. This is where we are promoting the *Goal* of he current *Campaign*.

## Every closed tasks moves progress forward
And whenever a *Contributor* completes and *assigned* *Task* he can see the green *Progress Bar* of the corresponding *Milestone* moving forward.

*??? Two people talking to each other, one has question "Question mark" other has answer "Exclamation mark". Both have speech bubble. Each speach bubble has 3 items represented by polygon items of different corner count. Two items map randomly, one item maps 1:1 ???*



*V²Plan* is made for the *V²Agile Development System* which is a unified Agile Development system for: **1)** Standards **2)** Software **3)** Hardware. 

V²Agile is based on the *Agile Development System* for Software and the *Toyota Production System* for Hardware. 

*V²Plan* and *V²Agile* use the tools: *GitHub* and *Waffle* for implementation.

Each development or production system and each tool come with their own terminology. In this chapter we list the terms used in V²Plan which is not always consistent. In this Chapter Mapping 

## Items

*??? Create Icons for Item. We can use in many places in all Manuals to add visuals. We can use the same tool tip on SVG. We can even link to the table with more text information ???*

| V² Term | V² Use | Agile-DS / Toyota-PS Equivalent|
|------------:|:---------|:-------------------|
|True North | Whenever presented with choices we pick the one that brings us closest to our final goal *True North* | The *Toyota Production System* heavily uses *True North* this way.|
|Road Map | Sequence of Campaigns. Each sitting on the shoulders of the previous Campaign. Each moving V² closer to *True North*. | Road Map. Agile is not so specific about it.
|Campaign | A campaign focus all our efforts to create and promote new shippable products. It is a group of milestones. | Project, as in group of Epics. Promotion aspect is not covered in Agile. |
|Milestones | Grouping Issues into one shippable product or major shippable product increment which marks a Milestone for V². | Epic, as in Groups of User Stories |
|Weekly Sprint | Smaller group of Issues (of the same Milestone) into a small shippable product increment. | Weekly Sprints as in 1 ... 4 weeks are the heart of Agile and it is very well structured and documented. (*1) |
|Daily Sprint | One Issue or few small issues making a tiny (if at all) shippable increment | Daily Sprint. Same comment applies as to *Weekly Sprint* |
|Issues | Grouping Tasks | User Story or Card |
|Tasks | Tasks as in Things to do in an Issue | Tasks as in Things to do on a Card

<font color=#777>(*1) We apply *Agile-DS* 100% for Software, borrowed from Toyota-PS what *Agile-DS* is missing for Hardware and added what is missing for Standards.</font>

V²Plan's Architecture is designed to efficiently support Agile Development:

1. Data Structures
2. Tools
3. Visualization
4. Roles



## Data Structures

### Planning → True North
The birth of V² was on the Facebook VillageViDock page in 2011, when the Community wanted PCI Express Expansion Box that works with many different computer. Over the next two years Hubert took on the role of Product Owner and developed with the community our *True North*: The Vision of a Modular PC with the PCI Express Expansion Box to be one part of the whole. More → [V²True North](#v2-true-north).

### Project → Campaign
The Road Map shows the way to reach True North via consecutive Campaigns. A campaign is a group of Milestones and lasts about 3 months while focusing all our efforts. As such a Campaign functions as the Major Project in Agile. At V² Initiative Hubert is the Product Owner and has worked with key members of the Community to develop our next campaigns, which are published on the [Plan section of V² Home Page](http://v-squared.github.io/#plan). We publish at least one future campaign ahead to make it easy for the community to request changes without forcing planning anew, which would be the case when changing a Campaign that is already in Sprint. More → [V²Campaign](#v2-campaigns).

### Product Backlog → Milestones
The Product Owner Hubert works with the corresponding Scrum Masters to break a Campaign into Milestones, which are a buckets of GitHub Issues. Each Milestone is created to have a *shippable* *Products* or *Product Features*. As such what we refer to as *Milestones* in *V²Plan* is referred to as *Product Backlog* in *Agile*.   More → [V²Milestones](#v2-milestones).


## Tools

## Visualization

## Roles
Roles are described in detail → [V²Sprint User Manual]()???




# V²Agile manages items *not* people
V²Plan is where we want to go and V²Agile is how we are going there. V² is a *Big Undertaking* and as such requires management. 

That said we subscribe to the key principles and methods of Agile, which is: People are smart and don't need to be managed. Tell them where to go and they will find a way to go there.

However, so many items such as features, deadlines, test criteria, etc ... are involved, that managing these is absolutely necessary. 

??? Sort in Writing from my old Article???


# V² Plan Architecture supporting Management
## No Milestone spanning Repositories

## V² Sprint
→ [V² Sprint Manual](https://github.com/V-Squared/v2-Plan/wiki/v2-Sprint-Manual)


# Management
## Responsibility & Delegation
- **Issue Owner:** Each Issue has one owner. He is ultimately responsible.
- **Issue Assignee:** Each issue has one assignee. She is responsible to get the work done. All progress or lack thereof is reported in comment to issue.
- **Task Assignee:** Each task can be given one @mention. He is responsible to complete the task. When done he need to tick it.

## Finding Work

## Asking for Help

## Reporting Progress

## Project Manager staying on Track
### All Issues of Milestone
### Project SCRUM Board in Waffles
### Manually updated Campaign Chart


## Do not leave data in GitHub Issues or Wiki
GitHub Issues or GitHub are great for what they are intended for. However, when synchronizing a Git Repository using a Git Client such as *Smart Git* they are not included and as such they are not archived. For this reason all our workflows must include that if at some point data aka Know How is stored in Issue or Wiki it will be transferred into an Article in the <>Code section.

# Contribution
The V²Plan resides in the *<>Code* section of its v2-Plan repository. As such contribution is as always:

- **Report Bugs:** Use GitHub Issues to report a Bug
- **Fix a Bug:** Fork the repository, fix the bug, make a *Pull Request*. We will include your fix.
- **Offer your help:** Study the projects of the current campaign. Then create an issue in this repository with a suggestion on how you can hep. We will reply to you as comment in the issue.


# Pages
## Find my work
The work to do is listed in GitHub Issues. But it is hard to develop and apply the right filters to find it. On the "Find my Work" Page these filters are build and easy accessible with a press of a button.

- **My Issues:**

## Campaign Map

## Road Map

## Campaigns
- **Campaign Brief:**
- **Campaign Plan:** Gantt
- :**Issues in Milestone List:** Filtered by Milestone
- Milestone Progress
- **Issues in Campaign List:** Filtered by Campaign Flag
- **Campaign Management:** Page designed for the *Campaign Manager* to quickly find: **1)** Projects behind schedule **2)** Issues that are stuck.



## Progress Report
-  **Automatic report in Milestone List:** 
- ** 

## Teams

## Repositories

## Round Trip Navigation
- **In Gantt:** 
   - Clicking Milestone opens a new tab with all its Issues listed in GitHub Issues
   - Both open and closed issues are listed
- **In Issues:**
   - Clicking its milestone icon reloads page showing list of all issues to this milestone
   - We list a link to go to Gantt chart of this issue in its reference section 



# Visualization
## Campaign → Brief & Gantt Chart
- **Purpose:** Understand all key aspects of the campaign in a glance
- **Fields:**
   - Target
   - Timing
   - Key Projects
   - Key Motivation
### Milestones → Gantt Chart
- **Purpose:** Show dependencies of Milestones in timeline
- Each  is visualized by its own Gantt Chart
- Each Milestone is one Row in the Gantt Chart
- Current Stages are shown and linked in Time Line in V² Home Page

### Issues → GitHub Issues List & Progress
- An overdue Milestone is shown in red
- Progress of all tasks of all issues of one milestone is consolidated and shown in progress bar


## Milestone Completion
The green progress bar in *Milestones* only shows percentage of closed *Milestones*. It does not consider closed *Tasks*.

- **Example 1:** 10 Issues with each 10 Tasks, out of which 9 of 10 are checked will show 0% complete, although they should show 90% complete.
- **Example 2:**  10 Issues with each 10 Tasks, out of which 0 of 10 Tasks are checked in every *Issue*. However, 2 Issues are closed. The green progress bar will show 20% complete, although they should show 0% complete.

### Conclusion to properly use *Progress*
1. Only close *Issues* after all of its *Tasks* have been ticked
2. Understand the progress of *Open Issues* by viewing their respective  *Progress Bars* as shown in the *List of Issues of Milestone*.

**Tip:** The first lines must be a *GitHub Markdown Task List* or the *Tasks* may not be considered when showing the *Issues Progress Bar*. In fact if you place the *GitHub Markdown Task List* somewhere lower down in the Issue, no *Issues Progress Bar* might be shown at all.

# Plan on V² Home Page
## True North
We will draw an image how the world will look like in 2021 after the successful introduction of V². It is a list of User Stories written in the perspective of: PC User, Journalist, Developer, Manufacturer, Retailer, Standard Community, so it is easy for you to find yourself and what V² will do to improve your life.

## Campaigns
Each Campaign is moving us closer to reach True North. 

## Projects


The Road Map shows the way to reach True North with key releases for each Quarter. Milestones breaks each quarter down into release targets for each month.

Finally each target is broken down into projects, that are manged in GitHub Issues.


# Page Structure in Plan
## Plan Home² 
- **Plan Portfolio:** Repeat the 3 Folio Items of the V² Home Page.
- 

## True North Home³
- **Layout:** Article Home Page
- **Articles:** On True North
- 
## Road Map & Campaigns Home³
## Projects Home³


# Labels

## Purpose
The purpose of labels is for you to invest a little time into classification to save big time when you need to search.

## Labels groups and their function in V²Plan:

1. board: Which Section of our Organization the issue belongs to.
2. debt: Technical debt. It need to searched for and found later.
3. help: What kind of helpt the Assignee is looking for.
4. size: Size of issue to give idea on how long it takes to finish
5. sprint: Column information for Waffle Kanban Board.
6. type: What kind of data is created with execution of the issue.
7. urgent: What needs to be done ASAP.


## Color Code
- Visually groups labels for faster access and faster comprehension

## When to assign what label
The following table lists all labels and explains when to assign what label and what actions are requested by the assignment of a label.

## Real world example
→ [GitHub►V²►V-Squared.github.io►Issues►Labels](https://github.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/labels)

## Tip
Most repositories use colons in the label name to structure groups. E.g. "sprint: now". This leads to hard to read URLS: ```https://github.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/labels/sprint%3A%20now```. Using dots gives you two benefits: First your label names are shorter: "sprint.now". Second your URL remains legible: ```https://github.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/labels/sprint.now```


# Navigation in Plan


# Burn down

# User Manual
## Campaign Manager
### Creating Road Map
### Creating Campaign
### Burn down campaign

# Pages / Bookmarks / Workflow

# Branching / Merging

# Improvements
These are the improvements when compared to previous method of planning:

1. Timing and dependencies of projects is visiolized in Campaign Gantt Chart
2. We can see a list of all Issues of one project
3. We can see progress of project in progress bar of milestone
4. It is very easy for a contributor to find next thing to do by looking at open issues
5. Specific procedures for Creating Campaign, Burn down campaign
6. Optimized procedures for daily work with specifc page designs and bookmarks


# Reference
- [angular-gantt](https://github.com/angular-gantt/angular-gantt) Reads Gantt Data from JSON and renders Gantt Chart as HTML + SVG + CSS. We will use this one first.
- [gh-issues-gantt](https://github.com/neyric/gh-issues-gantt) automatically render Gantt Chart of GitHub Issues. We may use this as an example project to understand how to read the GitHub API. Then write the data into the JSON of **angular-gantt**.
