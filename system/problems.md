# Problems of the past
## No clean cut between Campaign and Project Manager


## Project Manager has no simple overview

## No Gantt Chart for Campaign

## No Burn Down Chart for Milestones

## No SCRUM Board for Milestones

## One Milestone is spread across Repositories


# Solutions
## Clean and limited Job description of Campaign Manager

## Project Manager continues where Campaign Manager ends

## Each Milestone is unique to one Repository

## Project Manager track schedule of Project, reports to Campaign Manager

## SCRUM Board with Waffle is very efficient
- yet Waffle is optional!
